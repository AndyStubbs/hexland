## Features
- Procedural generation of hexagonal maps.
- Smooth zooming and scrolling for map exploration.
- Interactive tile selection with visual feedback.
- Responsive design for consistent performance on various screen sizes.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

## How to Use
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the map.
- **Scroll**: Click and drag the map to scroll in any direction.
- **Select Tiles**: Click on a hex tile to select it. Selected tiles will be highlighted.
- Procedural map generation occurs automatically on load, creating a unique map every time.

## How It Works
1. The hexagonal grid is rendered on an HTML5 `<canvas>` element.
2. Procedural generation assigns random properties (e.g., terrain type) to each hex tile.
3. Zooming and scrolling are implemented using canvas transformations for smooth performance.
4. Tile selection uses mouse events to detect and highlight the clicked tile.
